### Hi there 👋🏼 I'm Brandon

I'm a data analyst currently working on advancing my career within data science. At the moment I'm learning deep learning with PyTorch through [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) and working on building a personal website to better showcase the projects I've done.

Interested in collaborating on a project? In Berlin and want to grab a ☕️? Feel free to reach out to me anytime.

If you interested in joining the AI community in Berlin, check out meetup.AI!
