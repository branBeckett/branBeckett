### Hi there 👋🏼 I'm Brandon

I'm a data analyst currently looking to advance my career within data science in Berlin. At the moment I'm learning deep learning with PyTorch through [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) and working on building a personal website to better showcase the projects I've done.

Are you interested in collaborating on a project? In Berlin and want to grab a ☕️? Feel free to reach out to me anytime.

And if you interested in joining the AI community in Berlin, check out [meetup.AI](https://www.meetup.com/meetupai-Berlin/)!
