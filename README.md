### Hi, I'm Brandon.

I'm a senior data analyst & analytics engineer currently working in the heart of Berlin.

Anything that is physically possible can be accomplished with enough knowledge, so it's my goal to bring a few of those incredible technologies from the future into our present, and help make all our lives just a little better.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you're interested in collaborating on a project, have a virtual chat, or if you're in Berlin and want to grab a coffee.

Also, if you're interested in joining the AI community in Berlin, check out [meetup.AI](https://www.meetup.com/meetupai-Berlin/)!
